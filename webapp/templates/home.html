                            <h3><img src="/static/img/balance.png">Balance Team Vote</h3>
                            <p>This vote will decide how the balance team will be formed in the future. We can let the balance team be elected by the community or continue the approach of the past years to let the balance councilor appoint the team based on who he considers suitable.</p>
							<p>You can find Blackheart's post that asks for an elected team <a href="http://forums.faforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=13130">here</a>, and Zock's and other responses <a href="http://forums.faforever.com/viewtopic.php?f=67&t=13130&start=40#p135382">in the same thread</a>.</p>
							<p>An appointed team would continue the current approach to balancing, while an elected team would work as following:
							<ul>
							<li>The team will consist of five members elected by the community</li>
							<li>The balance councilor can additionally appoint up to three people to the team to make sure unknown but motivated persons are not prevented from contributing. The vote majority will lie with the elected members however.</li>
							<li>All balance decisions will be voted by the team, every member has one vote.</li>
							<li>The balance councilor will not be part of the team and won't take part in the balance votes. He will decide in case of vote parity, organise the elections, replace inactive or otherwise unfit members and mediate in case of disagreements. He will make sure the balance team is a functional body.</li>
							<li>Each member will pledge to put in the neccessary work and time to release new balance patches.</li>
							<li>Elections will be every 6 months.</li>
